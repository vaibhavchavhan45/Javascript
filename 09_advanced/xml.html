//XMLHttpRequest : Send a request to a server and get data back ‚Äî without reloading the webpage.
//Steps to make an AJAX request using XMLHttpRequest : open() i.e. Initialize the request, send() i.e. Sends request, readyState() i.e. it handles server responce

/*   
| `readyState` |    Name            |  Meaning                                                           |
| ------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `0`          | `UNSENT`           | Request not created yet (you haven‚Äôt called `open()` yet)          |
| `1`          | `OPENED`           | Request is created and ready to be sent (`open()` has been called) |
| `2`          | `HEADERS_RECEIVED` | Server has accepted the request and sent response headers          |
| `3`          | `LOADING`          | Response body is being received (partial data is coming)           |
| `4`          | `DONE`             | Full response has been received ‚Äî request is complete              |


When the code runs, we first create an XMLHttpRequest object. Then we use open() to prepare the request 
with a method like GET and a URL. After that, we call send() to actually send the request to the 
server. While the request is in progress, the onreadystatechange function runs every time the 
state changes. When readyState becomes 4 and status is 200, it means the full response has been 
received successfully. We take the response from responseText, and then use JSON.parse()
 to convert it from a string into a JavaScript object so we can access specific values like data.followers.


 //status === 200 meaning : Request was successful and the server sent the expected response.

| Status Code | Meaning                  | When it Happens                                                       |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `200`       | ‚úÖ OK                    | The request was successful and the server sent the response properly. |
| `404`       | ‚ùå Not Found             | The URL is wrong or the resource doesn't exist.                       |
| `500`       | üí• Internal Server Error | Something went wrong on the server.                                   |
| `403`       | üîí Forbidden             | You‚Äôre not allowed to access this resource.                           |
| `401`       | üîê Unauthorized          | You need to log in or provide a valid token.                          |
